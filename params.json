{"name":"N. Seymour-Smith","tagline":"Electronic hardware and digital interfaces","body":"## About me:\r\n\r\nHi! I'm a freelance technologist living in Brighton, UK. I design and program electronics for interactive experiences, incorporating multi- input and output sensing and feedback.\r\n\r\nI have extensive experience designing electronic hardware, and programming PC interfaces for sensor, monitor and feedback-control devices. I also design and build stand-alone automated modules with microcontroller processing using a range of chips (PIC, dsPIC, ATmega, Arduino).\r\n\r\nI'm a former quantum-technologies researcher with seven years experience building precision experiments and technologies for academic research (itcm-sussex.com). I go to BarCamps in south-east England (http://2013.barcampbrighton.org/), and can be quite regularly seen at the Skiff attending Things(TM) (http://theskiff.org/). I like to talk about how quantum physics is really not any more or less insane than regular physics(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZtw1yt8Kc), and I also play the ukulele. \r\n\r\n## Previous work:\r\n### Photobot custom automated photobooths\r\n\r\n### An integrated fiber trap for single-ion photonics\r\n\r\n### All-optical broadband excitation of the motional state of trapped ions\r\n\r\n### Fast scanning cavity offset lock for laser frequency drift stabilization\r\n\r\n## Contact me:\r\nIf you're interested in getting in touch about work or consultation, drop me an e-mail at nic.rss@gmail.com.
