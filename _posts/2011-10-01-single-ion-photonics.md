Ion traps for single-ion photonics
---------------
Part of my research at the ITCM research group at the University of Sussex was to build the ultimate in minimalist digital communication: An interface between a single atom and a single particle of light (called a `photon'). Check out the webpage for more information. (Illustrations also made in POVRay)
