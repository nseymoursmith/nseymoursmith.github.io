HackHD Serial interface with Arduino
---------------
A serial command interface for the HackHD 1080p camera via an Arduino. This code provides a hardware interface between arduino and HackHD, and a command interface to the arduino via serial. I've also included a hardware setup manual in pdf. This code and hardware setup was commissioned by photobot.co for their custom photobooths and is shared with their kind permission. Have a look and let me know what you think!
