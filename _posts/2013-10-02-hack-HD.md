description: A serial command interface for the HackHD 1080p camera via an Arduino. This code provides a hardware interface between arduino and HackHD, and a command interface to the arduino via serial. I've also included a hardware setup manual in pdf. This code and hardware setup was commissioned by <a href="http://photobot.co">Photobot</a> for their custom photobooths and is <a href="http://github.com/nseymoursmith">shared</a> with their kind permission. Have a look on my github page and let me know what you think!
