description: Musical doodles is an interactive doodling and sound stall first developed in collaboration with WLTM/ake for the Happy Planet Doodlefest's Doodle Marathon, an event put on to celebrate the opening of Brighton's Fringe festival. Aimed at exploring the joys of doodling, we encourage members of the public, children and adults alike, to doodle a representation of a sound or an emotion in conductive ink, and pin it up to our interactive sound-board. The doodles then become buttons that activate sounds from drums to synths and recordings made by the users. The musical doodle stand presents opportunities for creativity and collaboration for all ages and levels of engagement. Draw an intricate set of musical keys to control finely tuned synths or scribble and bang to your heart's content. Since the device is MIDI compatible, you can even plug in your own laptop and hook up to your own sequencers, synths, or generative visualisations.
