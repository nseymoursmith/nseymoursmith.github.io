description: Chemistry, up until recent decades, has always consisted of a somewhat `sledgehammer' approach - We take one beaker consisting of billions upon billions of molecules, and combine it with another consisting of yet billions more, all of which are at temperatures that correspond to the molecules travelling at hundreds of metres per second (yes, that is how fast single particles move at room temperature!). One part of my research concerned the question of what happens when we look at the chemical reactions between single pairs of molecules when they only move at a few metres per second. This regime is known as the ultra-cold regime of quantum chemistry.
