<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me:</h3>

<p>Hi! I'm a freelance technologist living in Brighton, UK. I am interested in the design and programming of electronics for automated products, installations and interactive experiences.</p>

<p>I have extensive experience designing electronic hardware, and programming PC interfaces for multi-input and output sensor, monitor and feedback-control devices. I also design and build stand-alone automated modules with microcontroller processing using a range of chips (PIC, dsPIC, ATmega, Arduino).</p>

<p>I'm a former quantum-technologies researcher with a doctorate and seven years experience building precision experiments and technologies for <a href="http://itcm-sussex.com">academic research</a>. I go to <a href="http://2013.barcampbrighton.org/">BarCamps</a> in south-east England, and can quite regularly be seen at the <a href="http://theskiff.org/">Skiff</a> attending <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Brighton/">Things</a>. I like to talk about how <a href="http://youtu.be/XEZtw1yt8Kc?t=1m39s">quantum physics</a> is really not any more or less insane than regular physics, and I also play the ukulele. </p>

<p>This is a simple function for receiving and constructing strings sent to an Arduino via its serial interface. I don't know why there isn't a built-in command for this! (This code is a minor practical improvement on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5697047/convert-serial-read-into-a-useable-string-using-arduino">this</a> found on stack overflow).</p>

<p>Although laser beams always travel in a straight line, <em>odd</em> things happen to the shape of the beam near the focus. Here's a mathematically rigorous look at what's happening. Play with the code to explore the dynamics!</p>

<p>Part of my research at the <a href="http://itcm-sussex.com">ITCM</a> research group at the University of Sussex was to build the ultimate in minimalist digital communication: An interface between a single atom and a single particle of light (called a `photon'). Check out the webpage for more information.</p>

<p>Chemistry, up until recent decades, has always consisted of a somewhat `sledgehammer' approach: We take one beaker consisting of billions upon billions of molecules, and combine it with another consisting of yet billions more, all of which are at temperatures that correspond to the molecules travelling at hundreds of metres per second (yes, that is how fast single particles move at room temperature!). One part of my research concerned the question of what happens when we look at the chemical reactions between <em>single</em> <em>pairs</em> of molecules when they only move at a few metres per second. This regime is known as the ultra-cold regime of quantum chemistry. </p>

<p>In order to conduct cutting edge research, we need cutting edge tools. Much of my research time was spent developing new techniques for ultra-precise control and probing of single atoms, molecules and photons. This is where I cut my teeth in electronics design, automation and feedback control.</p>
