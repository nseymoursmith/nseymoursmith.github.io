                    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m a technology consultant living in Brighton, UK. I am interested in the design and programming of electronics for automated products, installations and interactive experiences. I can build product prototypes or one-offs, and tie together different sensor and interaction technologies for unique events and applications.</p>

                    <p> I have extensive experience designing electronics and hardware for sensor and feedback applications with PC interfaces written in Python, C++ and Java, or stand-alone automated modules with microcontroller-processing using a range of chips (PIC, dsPIC, ATmega, Arduino), and communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, Bluetooth, and NFC/RFID.</p>
