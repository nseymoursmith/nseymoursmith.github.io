### About me:

Hi! I'm a technology consultant living in Brighton, UK. I am interested in the design and programming of electronics for automated products, installations and interactive experiences. I can build product prototypes or one-offs, and tie together different sensor and interaction technologies for unique events and applications.

### Technologies:
I have extensive experience designing electronics and hardware for
sensor and feedback applications with PC
interfaces or stand-alone automated modules
with microcontroller-processing using a range of chips (PIC, dsPIC,
ATmega, Arduino), and communication protocols such as SPI, I2C,
Bluetooth, and NFC/RFID.

### Additional info:
I tutor for the Digital Arts MA at the University of Brighton, work on
and develop technology and crafts workshops for children and am a former quantum-technologies researcher with a doctorate and seven years experience building precision experiments and technologies for academic research. I go to BarCamps in south-east England, and can quite regularly be seen at the Skiff attending Things. I like to talk about how quantum physics is really not any more or less insane than regular physics, and I also play the ukulele.
