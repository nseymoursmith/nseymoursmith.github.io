### About me:

Hi! I'm a technology consultant living in Brighton, UK. I am
interested in the design and programming of electronics for automated
products, installations and interactive experiences. I can build
product prototypes or one-offs, and tie together different sensor and
interaction technologies for unique events and applications.

### Technologies:
I have extensive experience designing electronics and hardware for
sensor and feedback applications with PC interfaces or stand-alone
automated modules with microcontroller-processing using a range of
chips (PIC, dsPIC, ATmega, Arduino), and communication protocols such
as SPI, I2C, Bluetooth, and NFC/RFID.

### Additional info:
I tutor for the [Digital Arts
MA](http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/study/media-arts/digital-media-arts-lighthouse-ma)
at the University of Brighton, work with [Exploring Senses
CIC](http://exploringsenses.co.uk/) on technology and crafts workshops
for children and am a former quantum-technologies researcher with a
doctorate and seven years experience building precision experiments
and technologies for [academic
research](http://www.itcm-sussex.com/). I go to BarCamps in south-east
England, and can quite regularly be seen at the Skiff attending
technology meetups. I like to talk about how quantum physics is really
not any more or less insane than regular physics, and I also play the
ukulele.
